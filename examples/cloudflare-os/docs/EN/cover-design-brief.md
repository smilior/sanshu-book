## 1. What we need

Please design a **book cover** for a Kindle edition (and, if possible, a B5 print layout).  
The interior is already set in HTML. The cover should make the topic obvious at a glance and feel approachable for non-engineers.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Deliverable | Cover image (Kindle + print if possible) |
| Uses | Kindle store listing, PDF/print cover, social thumbnails |
| Format | PNG or PDF (no transparency required). Editable source (Figma / AI / PSD) is welcome |
| Concepts | 2–3 options (different directions preferred) |

---

## 2. Book overview (design context)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Title | **Cloudflare OS Essentials** |
| Subtitle | **Build small apps safely with chat, not code** |
| Tagline | **Ask once, keep the tool.** |
| Author | smilior.com / Masahiro Nakagawa |
| Readers | Non-engineers first. People who want to fix small daily frictions themselves |
| Promise | Not large systems—**small apps** in natural language, linked **safely through Gatekeepers** |
| Position | **Unofficial** learning guide (not Cloudflare official docs) |
| Tone | Friendly, practical, honest. Avoid hype and “magic AI” vibes |

### Content cues (reference)

- Ask in chat → Accept → a tool stays on your desk  
- Examples: customer slides, weekly task board, GitHub Issue dashboard  
- Keywords: agent / Gadget / Blueprint / Gatekeepers  

---

## 3. Required text on the cover

Use the wording below **exactly** (no spelling variants).

1. **Title**  
   `Cloudflare OS Essentials`

2. **Subtitle**  
   `Build small apps safely with chat, not code`

3. **Tagline**  
   `Ask once, keep the tool.`

4. **Author** (under the tagline, center-aligned)  
   ```
   smilior.com
   Masahiro Nakagawa
   ```

### Do not include

- Year alone (e.g. 2026) as cover branding  
- “Official” wording that implies Cloudflare endorsement  
- Chapter lists, TOC, or “Hands-on 1 / 2 / 3” stacks  
- OAuth / API / .env and other deep technical detail  
- Long copyright text (that belongs in the colophon)

---

## 4. Visual direction

### Preferred feel

- Bright and calm, like a paper book (off-white to very light gray base)  
- Accent **green** near body highlight color `#2f9e5f`  
- Sparse composition so the **title stays readable in a thumbnail**

### Composition options (pick one or combine)

| Option | Image | Intent |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A. Type-led | Generous space. Large title. Minimal art | Trust; intro-book feel |
| B. Chat → result | Abstract chat bubble / input + one small app card | “Ask → keep” |
| C. Safe link | Soft node or key motif. No dense wiring diagram | “Connect safely” |

**Avoid**

- Wall of code / full terminal screens  
- Robots, brains, neon “AI stock” looks  
- Loud multi-color dashboards  
- Copying Cloudflare official branding (logos, site clone)

### Layout sketch (top to bottom)

```
[ space ]

        Cloudflare OS Essentials     ← largest, most readable
        ──────── (thin accent line OK)
        Build small apps safely with chat, not code
        Ask once, keep the tool.
        smilior.com
        Masahiro Nakagawa

[ space  or  one small graphic at the bottom ]
```

- Author block **center-aligned**  
- Tagline and author may use a softer gray than the subtitle  
- Title and subtitle in dark gray / ink for contrast  

---

## 5. Sizes and specs

| Use | Size | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|
| Kindle cover | About **1600×2560 px** (tall ~1:1.6) | Near Amazon guidance; adjust to store rules |
| Print B5 cover | **182×257 mm** (+3 mm bleed recommended) | Interior layout is B5 |
| Resolution | ~300 dpi for print / 2x for screen OK | |
| Safe area | Keep critical type out of outer 5–8% | Kindle crop |
| Color | sRGB (Kindle); print may convert to CMYK (confirm) | |

**Example file names**

- `cover-kindle-en-v1.png`  
- `cover-b5-print-en-v1.pdf`  
- `cover-source-en.fig`  

---

## 6. Project references

| Asset | Path / note |
|-------|-------------|
| Body HTML | `examples/cloudflare-os/EN/with-text.html` (title order and wording) |
| Body style | Accent green `#2f9e5f`, off-white ground |
| Message | Closing: small workplace apps, share/Blueprint, start small |

You do not need full UI screenshots as a full-bleed cover. If you use one, keep it light and limited to a single motif.

---

## 7. Acceptance criteria

A candidate should:

1. Read **“Cloudflare OS Essentials”** clearly at thumbnail size  
2. Convey **small apps** and **safety** from the subtitle  
3. Feel inviting to non-engineers (not a heavy textbook wall)  
4. Not look like official Cloudflare marketing  
5. Include all four required text blocks, with no typos

Subject: Cover design request — Kindle book “Cloudflare OS Essentials”

Hello,

This is Masahiro Nakagawa from smilior.com.

I’d like to commission a cover for the Kindle book **Cloudflare OS Essentials**.  
It’s a hands-on intro for non-engineers. I want a calm tone that shows “ask in chat, keep a small app on your desk.”

**Required text**

- Title: Cloudflare OS Essentials  
- Subtitle: Build small apps safely with chat, not code  
- Tagline: Ask once, keep the tool.  
- Author: smilior.com / Masahiro Nakagawa  

**Ask**

- 2–3 concepts  
- Tall Kindle image (about 1600×2560 px)  
- B5 print (182×257 mm + bleed) if possible  
- Avoid Cloudflare brand mimicry, full-bleed code, and loud AI stock looks  
- Accent green around #2f9e5f; light off-white ground  

Details, must-nots, and layout notes are in the attached `cover-design-brief.md`.  
Please reply with a first-draft date and a quote.

Thank you,

Masahiro Nakagawa
